The front-end of this application was created by myself during a 4 day sprint at Lambda School. It was built to the provided specs below.

The app is deployed here: https://app-lambda-notes.netlify.com/



# Front End Project Week

This week you will be building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes."

You are to treat this week as if you are working at a company and the instructor is your client. The project managers will be your main support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop the MVP feature set listed below using react and any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda School. There are design files in this repository you should use as a creative guide.
