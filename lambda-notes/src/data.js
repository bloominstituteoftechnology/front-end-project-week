Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Camelot! It's only a model. She looks like one. Oh, ow! I am your king."

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! I'm not a witch. Burn her anyway! You don't vote for kings.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!"

I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. What?! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?"
