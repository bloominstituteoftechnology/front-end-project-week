# Front-Back End Project Week
This week you will be building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes."

You are to treat this week as if you are working at a company and the instructor is your client. The teaching assistants are acting as your project managers and will be your main support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop the MVP feature set listed below using react and any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda School. There are design files in this repo you should use as a creative guide.  

## Trello Set Up:
* [x] Create a Trello account
* [x] Create a new board called "Lambda Notes"
* [x] Create lists titled ```backlog```,```To Do```, ```In Progress```, and ```Done```.
* [x] Fill in the ```To Do``` list with the MVP features listed below
* [x] Fill in the ```backlog``` list with all the extra features listed below
* [x] Share your board with the Project Manager that has been assigned to you.  If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your lead TA for guidance.

## MVP Features:
* [x] Display a list of notes
* [x] Create a note with a title and content
* [x] View an existing note
* [ ] Edit an existing note
* [ ] Delete an existing note
* [ ] Backend Set-Up
* [ ] Transfer functions to Express

Once you have accomplished the MVP, you have been given a feature list that the client would love to have completed.  Your goal would be to finish MVP as soon as you can and get working the list of features.

## Extra Features:
* Make the data persist with arrays / object literals (JSON) or a 3rd party service like Firebase
* [ ] Search functionality
* [ ] Markdown support in notes
* [ ] Sorting options in the list view
* [ ] Create and display tags that can be added to notes
* [ ] Drag sorting in the list view
* [ ] Add the ability to have checklists within the note view
* [ ] Export all notes to a CSV
* [ ] Create a login system around the MVP

You will notice that this repo doesn't have any starter code, this is on purpose.  You are to start from scratch using any files you have built throughout your time here at Lambda School.
