I'm obviously going to use a class component
In my component state I will have an array of objects 
Each object will be a different note. 
I will store this array of objects in redux store.
I'm going to try to keep everything as simple as possible to make this doable for me 
Just trying to get it to work.

The default beginning view will be an empty screen with menu options at the top of the screen
The menu options will be createNew, deleteExisting, editExisting, viewExisting, and searchExisting

The default state of the application has no notes.

invoking createNew will place a medium-sized text box on the screen, with two input fields, title, and body

invoking searchExisting will allow user to look up existing note using title as the key.
This will not be case sensitive as I will use .toLowerCase()

invoking deleteExisting will search for a note by key and delete it if it exists.

invoking viewExisting will search for a note and display it note as a rectangle box on the screen with the note inside of it
The view inside of rectangle box should scroll if needed

invoking ... wait what da fuq?

I think I only need 4 methods...I'm repeating myself here...
