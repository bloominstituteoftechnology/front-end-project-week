I'm obviously going to use a class component
In my component state I will have an array of objects 
Each object will be a different note. 
I will store all of these nodes in redux store.
I'm going to try to keep everything as simple as possible to make this doable for me 
Just trying to get it to work.

The default beginning view will be an empty screen with menu options at the top of the screen
The menu options will be createNew, deleteExisting, and editExisting.
As new notes are added, they will each display on the view, in expandable list form.
The view should scroll when multiple notes begin to overflow
