    textBody: "Finally, the Eminence Bass is the closest relative to a true upright bass to our hands and ears. It was the first EUB that really caught Bob's attention, that he wanted to continue to play and enjoy -- it has the vibe, both literally and figuratively-- the vibrations of a truly acoustic instrument against the body, and the feel of a true double bass neck. It is constructed like a full size double bass, with a bass bar and sound post. It has a nicely crafted removable wooden bout to put the bass in the perfect playing position. And while the acoustic sound is not loud enough, unamplified, to perform with, it can be practiced without an amp, as the acoustic sound is quite pleasing but won't be transmitted throughout the house.",

This NS CR4M model adds EMG magnetic pickups, for even more flexibility of tone beyond the Polar bridge pickups. A 3 position switch lets you choose the output of the two types of pickups, and you can also adjust each string's coil of the neodymium magnets for as punch as you desire, and to balance the output for your best tone.
