Here is where I intend to store various instructions and relevant information I may find useful.

How I envision the routing:

"/" and_or "Home" will route to the default list view
 -the EditList [Button] will be 

"/AddNote" will route to the AddNote form

"/Note[id]" will display the individual note
 -the EditNote [Button] will only be accessible here
 -the DeleteNote [Button] will be accessible here but not exlusively, upon clicking it,
    the page will route back to the default list view
