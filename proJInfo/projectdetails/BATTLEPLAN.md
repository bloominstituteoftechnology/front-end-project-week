# Battle Plan for the Front-End-Project


## Make Components folder with the following files and/or capabilities:
* Create new
* Delete
* List View
* Note View
I have decided to utilise a system similar to the "movies" project that we have previously worked on.
As such I will have a Note.js file, a NoteCard.js (specifically to style it neatly as a card like the movie app did.)
and a NoteList.js file that will be used to show all of the notes as a neat and pretty list of notes.
(ideally, we will add the capability to make it visible as a list OR a card. For now, we're going to use the card as default)


## Implement React-router and have the following routes:
* Home (displays the notelist)
* Note[id] (for displaying the individual notes)
* EditList (for deleting individual notes)
* EditNote[id] (for modifying individual notes)
