I decided upon yarn as my package-manager for this project. I ran the following inside the "client" folder.




yarn add react redux react-redux react-dom react-router-dom

yarn add axios

yarn add bootstrap

yarn add reactstrap

yarn add redux-axios-middleware

inside of the ROOT folder, I had to run [yarn add cors] to make the server work.
