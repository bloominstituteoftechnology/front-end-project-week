#Thoughts and Ideas


### Id problem

#### How do I want to accomplish a unique id for each? Do I set a counter after the initial values and make that work by incrementing? Do I even need to set an id since I am building it this way? I could switch it to index and figure out a way to route it to the index key?

#### I think I solved the Id problem but I still need to test it tomorrow to find out how well it would work.

## View Note problem

#### I've been trying to figure out a way to display notes once they are clicked. I got it dug through the props I console logged and found a whole bunch of things I didn't know about had to set a new state and then mess with some other stuff it was a challenge.
