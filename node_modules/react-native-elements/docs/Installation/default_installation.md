# Default Installation instructions

If your project is a standard React Native project created using `react-native init` (it should have an ios/android directory), then follow these installation instructions:

## Step 1: Install react-native-vector-icons

If you already have installed **react-native-vector-icon** as a dependency for your project you can skip this step. Otherwise run the following command:

`npm i react-native-vector-icons --save && react-native link react-native-vector-icons`

*If you have any issues installing react-native-vector-icons, check out their installation guide [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) or debug it using [this issue](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/issues/503).*

## Step 2: Install react-native-elements

```
yarn add react-native-elements
```

**or**

```
npm i react-native-elements --save
```
