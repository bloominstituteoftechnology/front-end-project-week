# Installation with create-react-native-app or Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io) or [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) projects include **react-native-vector-icons** out of the box, so all you need to do
is install **react-native-elements**

```
yarn add react-native-elements
```
or

```
npm install react-native-elements --save
```

**Note:**

If you see the `UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY` warning for **react-native-vector-icons** like below, you can ignore it as *react-native-vector-icons* is already installed by *expo* or *crna*.
